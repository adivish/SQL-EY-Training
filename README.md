# SQL-EY-Training

📘 Overview



The SQL-EY-Training repository contains a structured set of SQL training modules designed to build practical skills in relational database querying, modelling and analytics.

It is organised into multiple modules (Module 1, Module 2, … Module 11) with sample exercises, datasets, and solutions to help learners progress from foundational SQL concepts to more advanced techniques.



🧮 What you’ll find



Folders Module 1 through Module 11 representing individual learning modules, each focusing on a different area of SQL and database practice.



Within each module:



Exercise scripts (.sql) or challenge statements



Example data setup or reference tables



Sample solutions or query walkthroughs



A README.md at the root to introduce the repository (this file) and possibly module-specific READMEs inside each folder for context.



🎯 Who is this for?



Beginners to intermediate SQL practitioners who want a guided, hands-on training path.



Developers, data analysts, BI professionals or anyone looking to sharpen their SQL skills in a structured manner.



Teams planning SQL up-skilling workshops or self-paced learning programmes.



🧰 How to use this repository



Clone the repo



git clone https://github.com/adivish/SQL-EY-Training.git

cd SQL-EY-Training





Pick a module (start from Module 1, or whichever module matches your current level)



cd Module1





Execute the SQL scripts



Use your preferred RDBMS (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL — check compatibility).



Load any sample data provided.



Run the exercise SQL files, attempt the questions, then review the solution.



Track your progress



Mark the modules you’ve completed.



Use the solutions as a reference and attempt modifying queries or adding your own variations.



✅ Module Outline (sample)



Module 1 – SQL basics: SELECT, WHERE, JOINs



Module 2 – Aggregations, GROUP BY, HAVING



Module 3 – Subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions)



Module 4 – Window functions



Module 5 – Modelling: normalization, keys and constraints



Module 6 – Performance: indexing, execution plans



Module 7 – Transactions, locking, concurrency



Module 8 – Advanced: JSON, spatial, full-text (if applicable)



Module 9 – Data warehousing / analytics patterns



Module 10 – Security, roles, multi-tenant design (optional)



Module 11 – Capstone exercises \& real-world scenarios

(Adjust module topics to reflect what is actually in each folder.)



🚀 Getting Started Tips



Ensure you have an SQL environment ready (e.g., MySQL server, client tool).



Before running exercises, look for any README or “setup” file in each module folder explaining how to load data.



After completing an exercise, tweak it: change filters, join additional tables, add edge-case queries. This builds depth of understanding.



Use version control: commit your solution modifications, experiment with queries and keep track of your changes.
